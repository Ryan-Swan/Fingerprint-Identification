# Neural-Network

*Description:* A neural network used to help classify fingerprints into 5 main classes: left, right, whorl, arch and tented arch. The neural network is trained in an 80/20 training/validation split and all the fingerprints are pre-processed before being passed in. The network is trained on fingerprints that have been normalized, binarised and been passed through a gabor filter.

*Hardware/Software requirements:* python3, TensorFlow, Keras
